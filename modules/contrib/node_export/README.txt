INTRODUCTION
------------
This module allows users to export nodes and then import it into another
Drupal installation, or on the same site.

This module allows user to export/import nodes if they have the 'export nodes'
or 'export own nodes' permission, have node access to view the node and create
the node type, and the node type is not omitted in node export's settings. The
module does not check access to the filter formats used by the node's fields,
please keep this in mind when assigning permissions to user roles.
